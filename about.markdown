My name is Elisa Uhura and currently I'm an undergrad in Computer Science at University of São Paulo in Brazil.

During my BSc Computer Science I've had 2 TA experiences:
one in "Introduction to Computer Science" and another in "Concurrent and Parallel Programming",
both with 50 students each.
I've also helped to organize the cycle of lectures 
[Semana da Computação](https://bcc.ime.usp.br/semana/)
for 3 years, doing mainly art and site design.

I'm having fun with computers since I was 11 and here is some of my professional experiences:

* \[2022, ongoing] Business Analyst @**Itau BBA** (São Paulo - Brazil):
    I'm working in internal quotation systems related to FX products with focus on high availability.

* \[2021, 3 months\] Software Engineer Intern @**Microsoft Azure** (São Paulo - Brazil):
    I developed internal features at Azure Data Factory using **C#** for ETL pipeline management and UX to expose those features using **Angular** and **TypeScript**. I conducted meetings with product and engineering teams to design and present the features.

* \[2020, 3 months\] Business Analyst Intern @**Itau BBA** (São Paulo - Brazil):
    I developed Excel Macros using **VBA** regarding automatic quotation of FX products. I had daily follow-up with the sales team for middle and large corporations regarding those operations.

My main topics of interest are **parallel programming** and **digital circuit design**.
Besides working, you'll probably find me reading *Peanuts* or going on long walks.

I'm also a maintainer at [RISC-V Brasil](https://www.riscvbrasil.org), were you can find material in Portuguese related to RISC-V processor development.
