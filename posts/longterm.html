  	  	The world of software moves fast in a sense that every year companies have the pressure to push new software features, refactor some of their products and unfortunately drop support for older versions.
  	  </p>
  	  <p>
  	  	Even though it is cool to have the latest and greatest its important to remember that productivity requires experience and practice. Thats why we must consider as custumers and developers how are we going to handle long term software usage.

        As I'm not an expert so my points may not be the most accurate, but I find it valuable to present them.

      <h2>
        How long is long term?
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is a hard line to draw. Hardware from 10 years ago differs a lot less from hardware from 20 years ago, looks like companies last around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211010042855/https://www.imd.org/research-knowledge/articles/why-you-will-probably-live-longer-than-most-big-companies/">20 years</a>, and humans do not live much longer than 100 years. This do not last forever, but there is no clear rule for how long they should last.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main point is that a line needs to be drawn. And not only that, we must considers ways to preseve the software after that. If it's use keys to sign patches, there should be a pair of keys for after end of support to be publicly avaiable, internal manuals that are no longer trade secret distributed and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The duration of the support depends on many factors like long term costs to keep a team devilering patches and support, technical dependency (how does a software that has a support of 10 years can use a library with 5 years support?), and so on. But the line can be of the minimum support duration and not the exact support duration.
      </p>
      <p>
        SaaS if a very problematic because the concept of using the version X.Y.Z may not even exist. You just use the product and it happens to have a version, but that is not under you control of which version you are running. The same may apply to Rolling release model.
      </p>
      <p>
        But long term must be time enough such that you can make use of it properly. Let's give a concrete example. Imagine that you're making an album. This process may take years, let's say, 3 years. Ideally your DAW should be supported for those 3 years so you can rely on it to finish your work. 
      </p>
      <h2>Dependency Chain</h2>
      <p>
        There must be a better name for it that dependency chain, but that is what I call it. Dependency chain is a collection of relation between elements such that element A depends on element B. In this dependency it possible to have cycle dependency (a compiler can depends on itself to compile) and the dependencies may change with time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When considering Long Term Use of a software, the chain must be known otherwise there is no way to trust the software itself. Saying that software A is going to have a support of 10 years while it uses a library B that only provides software for 5 years means that during A's lifetime, the provider may update the version of library B at least 2 or 3 times.
      </p>
      <p>
        A problem is that the cost of updating a library is unknown. It can be so huge that the team may fork the old version and support it by itself. And another one is that the time spent updating it is time not spent improving the product itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        A software that wants to have a life span of 5 years, should prefer libraries with support long enough to cover development and support. But this kind of information is not always disclosured and may not be even possible to be determined when the software ecosystem around is not mature enough.
      </p>
      <h2>Hope</h2>
      <p>
        Outside enterprise level sulutions mostly of what is left is hope in the end. For example, OpenGL support is deprecated for many years on iOS and MacOS but how knows when is Apple going to drop it...
      </p>
      <p>
        I belive there is not only space for a more formal way to share support information, but value too. But I must admit that supporting a library major for 20 years does not look very exciting.
