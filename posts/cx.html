        Cx is my magnum opus. A concept of programming environment.
        Something that representes the almagalmation of many ideas
        that floats on my mind.

      <p>
        Cx is pronounced just like the word <i>sex</i> beacause it is
        based of the portuguese pronunciation of the letter C and english
        pronunciation of the letter x.
